1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,320
CHRIS HEILMANN: Hello and
welcome to the one before last

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,810
session on privileged access.

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:10,910
That's why I brought
the POLIZEI

5
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:14,690
tee shirt to give you, not
there, not there, we go there.

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,180
So it has to be organized.

7
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,300
So we've got a panel of
illustrious people here.

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,000
So we got Diana from Vodafone.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,560
We've got Paul Kinlan
from Google.

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,093
We've got Petro Soininen--

11
00:00:25,093 --> 00:00:26,650
PETRO SOININEN: [INAUDIBLE].

12
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:26,960
CHRIS HEILMANN: OK.

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,960
Fair enough.

14
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,720
ex Nokia and now at Five.

15
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,369
And as we didn't have enough
blanket statements and

16
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:34,610
outrageous swearing, we actually
brought Brian Leroux

17
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:37,660
from PhoneGap with us as well
who is actually going to start

18
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,450
the whole session by
telling us-- for 10

19
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,890
minutes and not longer--

20
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:45,060
what we are all about here
about privileged access.

21
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,535
So take it away.

22
00:00:47,535 --> 00:00:50,930
Take your closed technology and
show us what you can do.

23
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:55,310

24
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:55,385
BRIAN LEROUX: OK.

25
00:00:55,385 --> 00:00:55,820
Can you guys hear
me all right?

26
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,596
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

27
00:00:57,596 --> 00:00:58,040
BRIAN LEROUX: Yeah.

28
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,860
Well except for old man Russell
in the front there.

29
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,580

30
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,110
So I'm going to talk to you guys
today about privileged

31
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,760
applications, packaged
applications, sometimes we

32
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,700
call them installable
web applications.

33
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,660
I've even heard it called
a thick client.

34
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:14,190
So--

35
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,220
oh come on pointer events.

36
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,830
There we go.

37
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:20,380
I work on a PhoneGap project
which you may have heard of.

38
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,930
It's for building apps using
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

39
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,240
And it's very much like a
packaged application.

40
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,400
You host the assets
on a device and

41
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,750
we load them locally.

42
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,740
They're intrinsically offline.

43
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,450
And it's also a powerful
extensibility layer.

44
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,380
So PhoneGap lets you get
at, basically, anything

45
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,750
the device can do.

46
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,310
And that's what we're
talking about.

47
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:44,600
So the question that we were
posing was, did the web solve

48
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,860
cross platform?

49
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,220
And I think when it comes to
things like screen sizes and

50
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,150
operating systems, the
web did solve cross

51
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,300
platform really well.

52
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,180
Somebody was talking about Steve
Jobs earlier when he

53
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,200
said, you're going to build
apps and you're going

54
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,400
to build web apps.

55
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,390
And I love that.

56
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,390
I thought that was
a great vision.

57
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:04,790
But web didn't solve
everything.

58
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,120
Web intrinsically is sandboxed,
and this is

59
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,960
actually not a bug.

60
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,080
This is a feature.

61
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,650
This is how the web works.

62
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,140
But because it has this
capability or this feature

63
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,650
that it's sandboxed, it
also doesn't have

64
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,690
access to device APIs.

65
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,480
And so it's at a disadvantage
when it comes to native

66
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:23,830
applications.

67
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,780
It's sandboxing.

68
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,660
I guess another disadvantage
of the web is that it can't

69
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,200
participate in app stores
which maybe

70
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,200
we'll talk about later.

71
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,230
I don't think this is exactly
what packaged

72
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,930
applications are all about.

73
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:38,110
So I don't know if you guys have
noticed but there's this

74
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:41,360
trend lately towards web
operating systems.

75
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,840
Google's got Chrome OS.

76
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,710
Microsoft has Windows 8, which
uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

77
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:48,040
to build applications.

78
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,740
Some guys called Mozilla
are doing a thing

79
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,590
called Firefox OS.

80
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,770
There's this thing called Tizen,
which is an open source

81
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:57,956
web operating system by
Samsung and Intel.

82
00:02:57,956 --> 00:02:59,425
And then there's
Web OS from HP.

83
00:02:59,425 --> 00:03:01,160
It kind of makes me sad so
I don't like to talk

84
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:01,730
about it too much.

85
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,730
But there's all these things.

86
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:07,450
So if you think about Google,
Microsoft, Mozilla, Samsung,

87
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,110
Intel, and HP are all betting
on the web for their next

88
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,760
operating systems which is a
pretty interesting thing.

89
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,480
And these are all privileged
applications and packaged

90
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,240
applications.

91
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,440
Mobile is not quite so kind, but
luckily, with PhoneGap we

92
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,680
can get to these things
and we can get

93
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,150
inside these app stores.

94
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:26,030
And this is not a cheap shot--
this is just a statement of

95
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,140
fact and it's kind
of interesting--

96
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,880
all of these app stores
themselves are web

97
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,580
applications.

98
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,930
They're hybrid apps.

99
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:32,720
You can't install an

100
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,800
application without the network.

101
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,790
And typically when you're
browsing for apps in an app

102
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,610
store, you're going
to the web.

103
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:41,330
So forgive me if you've heard
this before because packaged

104
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,460
apps are not a new concept.

105
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,110
This has been around
a long time.

106
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,490
It used to be widgets
inside of Vodafone.

107
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:49,320
There's this thing called
confabulator from Yahoo.

108
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:49,980
Think it was Yahoo.

109
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,100
PETRO SOININEN: Yeah.

110
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,350
BRIAN LEROUX: It was Yahoo.

111
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,930

112
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,150
Maybe this thing called AIR
from this other company.

113
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,870
I can't remember who they are.

114
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,300
The idea has been around
for a while though and

115
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,670
it's not a new thing.

116
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:04,600
So apps that are designed for
a particular platform are

117
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,345
incompatible by their nature.

118
00:04:06,345 --> 00:04:08,640
If you build for a particular
operating system, you're not

119
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,540
going to ship it on other
operating system unless you

120
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,130
believe Blackberry 10, you can
put Android apps on it but

121
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,410
that's another thing
all together.

122
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:20,070
So that's why we
have standards.

123
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,779
That's the point of
web standards.

124
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:23,410
And there's actually some
emergent standards that are

125
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,520
around this, and there's
some older ones too.

126
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,100
So there's a thing called the
Widget Spec, which kind of

127
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,870
died in a horrible death, but
it's around in its own way.

128
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:32,750
Bruce is going to cry.

129
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,810
I'm sorry, Bruce.

130
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,460
It's not around anymore.

131
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:40,120
There's the device API Working
Group at the W3C that thought

132
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,540
we need all these device APIs.

133
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,870
Let's standardize all this
stuff, but they didn't think

134
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,455
about the security model with
enabling things like camera

135
00:04:46,455 --> 00:04:49,390
and contacts and all
these device APIs.

136
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,270
So there's a new group now
called the System Applications

137
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,200
Working Group.

138
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,220
And it's starting with the idea
of the runtime context

139
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,030
and security model.

140
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,700
And I'll talk about that
in a little bit.

141
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,870
So to be really clear, what
we're talking about here is

142
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,150
packaged web applications.

143
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,600
We're not just talking about
packaged applications because

144
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,630
packaged applications
have happened

145
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,210
before and they've failed.

146
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,880
The web is naturally
interoperable.

147
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,160
The web has this DNA where
things are portable, and this

148
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,070
is what we're looking for.

149
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,980
And this is why packaged web
applications are important.

150
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,910
So this is where shit gets
a little bit boring.

151
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,950
Every application, or every
packaged application has to

152
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:22,395
have a manifest.

153
00:05:22,395 --> 00:05:24,380
And a manifest is going to have
things like your title,

154
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:28,100
your icon, your license, your
author, the things we need to

155
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,020
know what to display
when we have a

156
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,530
springboard for the app.

157
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,080
But then it starts to get a
little bit more interesting.

158
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,850
It also has to have an origin
because we need to know where

159
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,320
to go to update it, which
kind of comes back

160
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,130
to the offline stuff.

161
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,110
And it also needs to have white
listing for the network

162
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,640
because a packaged application
typically runs local on the

163
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,210
device but it needs to
know where it can

164
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:48,640
go to go get data.

165
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,780
Packaged applications also have
permissions for features.

166
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,740
We don't want every application
to have access to

167
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,130
your front facing camera, and
so you have to be able to

168
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,960
declare this.

169
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,940
Packaged applications are
also a runtime context.

170
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,170
So in the case of PhoneGap, we
run on the file protocol.

171
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:06,610
So file://indexHTML is
where we load stuff.

172
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:10,000
But this means that all these
applications intrinsically can

173
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,450
do cross domain requests, which
is dangerous, which is

174
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,760
why we have to white listing.

175
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,930
The runtime context also has
some weird properties that are

176
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:18,720
a little bit different than
other types of applications.

177
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,480
So window.open, for example,
might open an in-app browser

178
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,200
instead spawning a new tab.

179
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,680
File system locations can be
different, that kind of thing.

180
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,000
Thank god there's beer.

181
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,650
OK.

182
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:36,400
So I'm trying to go
quick here, Chris.

183
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,520
Apps live a really
weird lifecycle.

184
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,710
So an application right now in
a browser, you open a tab, it

185
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,800
starts up, you're good to go.

186
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,920
An application running in a
packaged application runs in

187
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,810
kind of these different modes
and so we have online and

188
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,480
offline events.

189
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,100
I'm of the opinion that we
actually need more information

190
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,370
than just online and offline
but we can talk about that

191
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,810
over the beers later.

192
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,570
We also have pause and resume
so there's something called

193
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:00,510
the page visibility API in the
web but it's a little bit

194
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,180
nascent right now.

195
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,670
And it's the same thing, but
when you're looking at

196
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,970
applications that are running on
a phone, we can put them in

197
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:05,550
the background.

198
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,760
They may or may not be able
to do anything about that.

199
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,990
Then there's system
notifications.

200
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,400
And so the classic example I
like to give here is a battery

201
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,350
notification event-- if your
battery is about to die, you

202
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,270
might want to back up
your information.

203
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,240
We implemented this in PhoneGap
and unfortunately,

204
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,560
polling the battery drained
the battery.

205
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,900
So we didn't know what
to do to fix that.

206
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,910
This is a property of packaged
applications too.

207
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:29,480

208
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,100
So there's runtime security
beyond the sandbox and this is

209
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,830
where stuff is most
interesting.

210
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,110
There's things like
network security.

211
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:38,050
There's encrypted key stores
possibly on some devices where

212
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:40,640
you can store data on
the phone securely.

213
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,330
And that's where we get
to device APIs.

214
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:45,240
So I like to put device
APIs into two buckets.

215
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,360
You've got system sensors
and you've got data.

216
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,270
Sensors are things like your
camera, your accelerometer,

217
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,430
your geolocation, and
that kind of stuff.

218
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,760
GPS.

219
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:59,080
Data is like your file, your
contacts, your media.

220
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,110
That's what we want to get at.

221
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,780
That's what the web
can't do today.

222
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,850
And that's where the web needs
to go if it wants to compete

223
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,740
with the native platforms
that are out there.

224
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,780
And that's why we're seeing
all this work going into

225
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,380
standardization.

226
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:12,700
So all this stuff is cool and
everybody wants it, but if

227
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,720
we're not careful, we're
going to shoot

228
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,200
ourselves in the face.

229
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,720
And this is why runtime
security

230
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,970
context is super important.

231
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:21,650

232
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,090
Awesome, right?

233
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:24,410
I just wanted to use that GIF.

234
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:25,428
It's all I got.

235
00:08:25,428 --> 00:08:26,678
Thanks.

236
00:08:26,678 --> 00:08:31,642

237
00:08:31,642 --> 00:08:34,039
Do you want to leave that?

238
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:37,130
CHRIS HEILMANN: It might be a
bit annoying after a while.

239
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,210
Let's just switch to
something nicer.

240
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:41,059
How do I type Mozilla's hiring?

241
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:42,169
No.

242
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:43,049
OK.

243
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:44,820
It's good when you get the
speakers drunk first because

244
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,853
then they're much faster
than normally.

245
00:08:46,853 --> 00:08:48,460
BRIAN LEROUX: Did
I go too quick?

246
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:48,780
CHRIS HEILMANN: No.

247
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,430
That's OK.

248
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,000
We've got more time for
questions then.

249
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,300
That's pretty good.

250
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:56,210
So as you said, it's an
interesting concept because I

251
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:59,330
spent the last few months now
talking about Firefox OS to

252
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,560
people and talking about
packaged apps to people.

253
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,080
And every time you talk about
web apps and people are like,

254
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,770
what is that?

255
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:10,060
I don't quite understand it and
it seems to be this hybrid

256
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,650
that people just don't
get around first.

257
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:18,210
So to start with that, what do
you think is the main thing

258
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:23,530
that keeps us from having proper
apps that could be, in

259
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:27,030
terms of privileges,
on par with

260
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:29,530
native apps at the moment?

261
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:30,990
Is it an understanding
problem?

262
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:35,060
Is it that every provider has
a different manifest format?

263
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,670
Is it that people just don't
trust web apps yet?

264
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,370
What do you think is the biggest
barrier that we have

265
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:39,970
to overcome?

266
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,190
Let's go through
you one by one.

267
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,640
Diana, what do think?

268
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:43,890
DIANA CHENG: OK.

269
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,290
There are few things.

270
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,520
Application packaging
is an issue.

271
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,082
It's completely fragmented
at the moment.

272
00:09:50,082 --> 00:09:50,560
Yeah.

273
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,490
This is the way I'm supposed
to hold it.

274
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,370
Another issue is security.

275
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:59,280
So everything that runs
in the browser has to

276
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,950
have limited access.

277
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:06,620
So as has been mentioned,
[INAUDIBLE] had a different

278
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,190
device APIs.

279
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:12,630
Working Group had a different
surface [? cope ?] first and

280
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:15,930
it was called device APIs and
policy working group.

281
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:20,020
And then the policy bit got
dropped because websites are

282
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:20,810
intrinsically--

283
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,770
or you have to assume that
they're going to be malicious,

284
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,110
that they can do
a lot of harm.

285
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:28,756
So they cannot get write
access to a lot

286
00:10:28,756 --> 00:10:31,300
of data on the device.

287
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,890
They need to be sandboxed
and all that.

288
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:36,480
So we need a different
sort of runtime.

289
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,730
We need a security model.

290
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:40,670

291
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:46,560
You know that the new working
group is working on new APIs

292
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:53,130
that have extended permissions
that will be installable, that

293
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,980
will, hopefully, be certified
by an app

294
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:58,240
store, will be signed.

295
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,590
And this is one of the
things that is new.

296
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:04,650
And it's great that we have
implementations like Firefox

297
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:08,000
OS and they're going to
put this in the wild.

298
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,110
It's not going to
be just specs.

299
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:11,580
It's going to be an
implementation.

300
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,880
CHRIS HEILMANN: Cool.

301
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,135
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

302
00:11:14,135 --> 00:11:17,600
So I think the biggest thing
for me is we haven't got a

303
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,550
unified permissions model.

304
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,520
We don't know.

305
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,490
If you're on the open web and
you're kind of driving past a

306
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:25,790
URL, we haven't got anything
that's even slightly

307
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:28,800
considered compatible
across browsers.

308
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,870
And I also think we haven't even
dealt with the fact that

309
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,210
a lot of the things that
we want to do in native

310
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:35,970
applications we want to do
with things like USB.

311
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:39,300
And we don't even know how
to like opt the user

312
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,220
into access a device.

313
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:45,270
In Chrome, we've got the ability
to query some device

314
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,770
ID to see if it's present on the
USB bus and then you can

315
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,270
open it up and read
and write to it.

316
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,300
But we're still trying to make
sure that we've got that

317
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,000
permissions model quite right.

318
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,204
BRIAN LEROUX: And isn't
that like a

319
00:11:54,204 --> 00:11:56,220
fingerprinting issue too?

320
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,530
PAUL KINLAN: Yes.

321
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:00,310
Well, that's actually why it
changed relatively recently.

322
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,800
Well, not exactly
why it changed.

323
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,708
BRIAN LEROUX: You've
accepted that

324
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,524
fingerprinting is going to happen?

325
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:07,200
PAUL KINLAN: Well I think
everyone always has to accept

326
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,520
fingerprinting at some point
is going to happen.

327
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,415
You can look at the EFF website
or whatever it is and

328
00:12:11,415 --> 00:12:13,490
they'll show you all the unique
characteristics of your

329
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,440
normal browsing session.

330
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,070
The thing from the USB side of
things is that we're trying to

331
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,850
get to this place where, maybe
in the manifest, you say that

332
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:24,020
this application can have access
to your Fitbit or those

333
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,980
types of different devices
because you normally have a

334
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,420
vendor ID and a product ID.

335
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,740
And then that might actually put
people off from actually

336
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,950
installing the application,
especially if

337
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:33,570
they don't have it.

338
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:38,430
So we're starting to also move
to this idea of a runtime

339
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,670
permissions model for those
types of things.

340
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,720
And I don't think any of the
browser vendors have even got

341
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,710
to any level of consistency.

342
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,190
That's my biggest thing.

343
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,470
CHRIS HEILMANN: Cool.

344
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:51,620
PETRO SOININEN: I think for me
it's the thing that even if

345
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:56,080
you actually understand what
the hybrid concept or the

346
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,000
package web app concept is, is
that a lot of the customers

347
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,410
that we work with just say that
they don't have enough

348
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:07,980
experience or enough examples
of packaged web apps that

349
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,680
actually do deliver the
UX that they're

350
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,580
going to be happy with.

351
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:16,330
So I think that we still lack
real showcases and real kick

352
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:20,170
ass applications that
actually deliver.

353
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,890
CHRIS HEILMANN: Which is quite
bizarre because seeing that

354
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:24,400
even in the native markets,
a lot of them are actually

355
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,560
packaged apps with PhoneGap.

356
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,570
They're just not advertised
as those.

357
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:29,370
BRIAN LEROUX: That's right.

358
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:30,190
Yeah.

359
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:32,546
CHRIS HEILMANN: And some AIR
ones as well, funnily enough.

360
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:33,340
BRIAN LEROUX: Tons.

361
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,442
CHRIS HEILMANN: Yeah.

362
00:13:35,442 --> 00:13:38,800
So the questions to moderator
are actually all going around

363
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,330
the same topic, which is the
biggest topic that everybody

364
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:47,160
has to deal with, how do I make
my end users realize that

365
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,320
they're giving permission
right now?

366
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,050
Do we really need to ask for
permission for everything?

367
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,430
And how do we make sure we don't
overload people with a

368
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,750
question every time they
do one action?

369
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,120
Do you want to move
the mouse left?

370
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:58,700
Are you sure?

371
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,080
BRIAN LEROUX: Yeah.

372
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,820
CHRIS HEILMANN: These
kind of things.

373
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,890
Where do we draw the line?

374
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,910
What is the real problem
with that?

375
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,820
BRIAN LEROUX: This is the key
issue to me because we don't

376
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:10,200
want to have web Vista where
it's like asking permission

377
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,030
for everything.

378
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,430
Can I access your camera?

379
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:13,600
Can I access your contacts?

380
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,000
Can I use your file system?

381
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,780
That user experience
would totally suck.

382
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:20,840
At the same time, we don't want
the user experience to be

383
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,380
website XXX has access to my
front facing camera and my

384
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:28,180
contacts, and yeah, we don't
have to go any further with

385
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,385
that analogy to know that
that's a bad thing.

386
00:14:31,385 --> 00:14:31,820
CHRIS HEILMANN: Speak
for yourself.

387
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,750
BRIAN LEROUX: So browser vendors
are challenged by this

388
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:37,420
too because I think Google's
proposing something.

389
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,160
They're trying to come up with
language in the system

390
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,450
applications working group.

391
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:43,610
How do we have this thing called
like a trust gesture

392
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:47,390
where you say to the browser,
hey, I trust this thing maybe

393
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:50,130
one time, or I trust it
for all the time.

394
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,280
We wanted to be able to get back
to those permissions and

395
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,430
look at them and maybe revoke
them possibly in case website

396
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:58,000
XXX turns a new leaf.

397
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,610
CHRIS HEILMANN: It's also
no timely access.

398
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:01,790
It always seems like it would
be a black and white thing.

399
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:04,020
I give access and that's it,
but I could grant, for

400
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:07,460
example, a guest pass for an
app to access my camera for

401
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:11,230
the next five minutes and then
I have to revoke that again,

402
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:13,130
or it revokes automatically.

403
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:16,730
I mean, Flickr had this for
guest access to your photos,

404
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:19,640
for example, that you could
send somebody a string and

405
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,020
like within an hour they could
look at your stuff but after

406
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,790
an hour they can't
login anymore.

407
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,260
That would be another
way of dealing with

408
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,860
that, wouldn't it?

409
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,700
That I could say, OK, for the
next five minutes I want to

410
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,040
try that app out but after that,
you don't get access to

411
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,440
the camera anymore.

412
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,900
PAUL KINLAN: I mean, we could,
but that exists anyway, right,

413
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,070
in the sense that if you do a
get-user media it normally

414
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,580
pops up a little bar
across the top.

415
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,320
It's because the hardware
manufacturer actually puts a

416
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,690
little LED at the front so you
know it's on, it's actually

417
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:46,220
doing stuff.

418
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:49,050
But once you actually finish
with the stream, then it

419
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:49,570
closes down.

420
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,310
The next time that you request
it you get the

421
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:52,250
prompt again normally.

422
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,180
CHRIS HEILMANN: Yeah.

423
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:54,510
PAUL KINLAN: I don't know.

424
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:57,240
I look at kind of having to
re-grant storage permissions

425
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,730
and increase storage.

426
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,470
People just press the buttons
normally and we don't know

427
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,400
what's going to happen, right?

428
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,880
BRIAN LEROUX: That's the
Android problem.

429
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,190
It's like, oh, this app wants
to do everything.

430
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,510
Cool.

431
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,436
Install.

432
00:16:08,436 --> 00:16:10,210
That's what happens.

433
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:12,538
Then, later on, you don't know
what permissions you've

434
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:14,435
granted this thing because you
can't find it because it's

435
00:16:14,435 --> 00:16:16,660
buried in the system.

436
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,620
CHRIS HEILMANN: One good
question was also when you

437
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,050
look at Facebook, for example,
you can give access to

438
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:22,080
everything in the world.

439
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,850
Then this app turns out to be
evil and you can actually stop

440
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:25,700
that access.

441
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,900
So you have a dashboard of all
the apps and what access they

442
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,210
have to which device.

443
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:32,115
So there's a centralized
way of doing that.

444
00:16:32,115 --> 00:16:34,700
Would that be a solution that
we could think about?

445
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,560
That instead of every app having
to ask these things, I

446
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,750
have a dashboard of this
app has access

447
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,690
to these five things.

448
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:45,520
So you have one grid on your
system that actually allows

449
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,180
you to control all of that.

450
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:48,306
PETRO SOININEN: Yeah.

451
00:16:48,306 --> 00:16:52,060
I think I'm in this on
the previous kind of

452
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,010
proposal that you make.

453
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:53,930
They both make sense.

454
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,690
And there are a lot of
other good ideas on

455
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:57,490
this front as well.

456
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:00,440
But I think one of the key
things is also just to make

457
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,210
sure that users actually
understand what are they

458
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,819
accepting and then, again,
the mechanisms--

459
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:06,540
how they can actually
control it.

460
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,500
So as you said, that they're
probably just going to be

461
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,738
pressing the OK, OK, OK and
not really think about it.

462
00:17:12,738 --> 00:17:14,349
But that's not really
technology.

463
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:18,200
It's more like psychology and
trying to figure out how

464
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,470
humans think.

465
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:21,550
BRIAN LEROUX: Paul , you were
talking about this at lunch.

466
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:26,920
You guys had difficulty with
the messaging or something.

467
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,430
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

468
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,630
If you look at the way that we
have our installable kind of

469
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:34,040
hosted apps and packaged apps
in the next packaged apps,

470
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:39,190
essentially, we have had kind
of this messaging issue.

471
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:41,600
If you go to install the
application, and you're on,

472
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,160
say, the detail page, it'll
tell you all the

473
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,510
things that it does.

474
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,030
I don't know how many users
actually look at that.

475
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:49,840
But when you press install,
there are at least three

476
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,650
different levels of ways that
we prompt the user.

477
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:56,030
So for some things like
unlimited storage, which is a

478
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,810
permission that you can have,
we don't even tell the user.

479
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,210
It's just kind of assumed.

480
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,680
There is, to your point before,
there's actually a

481
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,390
dashboard inside Chrome where
you can normally access like

482
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:07,430
the levels of permissions that
your applications have and

483
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,550
revoke them.

484
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,100
But normally, when you revoke
something, it means

485
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,230
uninstalling the application.

486
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,670
So that's a different
part as well.

487
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:14,900
CHRIS HEILMANN: Is it
an innovation thing?

488
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:18,230
Because we had app cache, then
we had local storage, then we

489
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:21,760
have IndexedDB, then we got Web SQL,
and we put an interface

490
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,510
for each of them in the browser
rather than having one

491
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:27,350
interface for storage and saying
OK, this app wants to

492
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,870
store stuff offline, wants to
store things in a database,

493
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,710
and wants to store things
only for this session.

494
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,420
Do you want to allow this?

495
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:36,390
Is it now the time to actually
look at all the browsers again

496
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,720
and find a unified interface
for that?

497
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,500
PAUL KINLAN: I mean, there's
also this idea of quota system

498
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,140
which has been banging around
for a little while.

499
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,870
You can request some storage
or an increase in unlimited

500
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,630
storage, for instance, and
it goes across all of the

501
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,720
different types of persistence
mechanisms that you have

502
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,460
inside the browser.

503
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,360
BRIAN LEROUX: Is that
the Quota API?

504
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:52,640
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

505
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,240
BRIAN LEROUX: Yeah,
yeah, yeah.

506
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,050
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

507
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,190
These things exist.

508
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,710
We just don't think we've
got consensus

509
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:59,960
amongst the vendors yet.

510
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,130
I don't know what we do
other than talk more.

511
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:03,480
CHRIS HEILMANN: Diana,
you wanted to--

512
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:03,710
DIANA CHENG: Yeah.

513
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,030
I just wanted to say with
regards to that, it's a

514
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:09,270
difficult thing to agree on
because there is no place to

515
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:09,920
agree on that.

516
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,700
So this is not something you
can write on a spec.

517
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,160
Right?

518
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,780
On the spec you write things
that are testable, that are

519
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:20,190
verifiable, but you don't
test UI stuff.

520
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:24,050
Even in geolocation there was
only so much we could ask.

521
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:28,700
You should specify the host of
the site that is requesting

522
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,340
the permission and
you show that.

523
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:35,380
But it's very, very hard to find
a place where you make

524
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,270
people agree on this.

525
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,990
CHRIS HEILMANN: So during lunch,
we talked about widgets

526
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:41,150
already and I remember
both Vodafone--

527
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:43,360
I worked back then on it-- and
Opera were the first ones to

528
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,200
do W3C widgets to actually
have little apps on your

529
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,410
desktop that can run even
when Opera was closed.

530
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:52,590
So that didn't take on.

531
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,300
Why do you think?

532
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,270
We needed the app model on
mobile phones for people to go

533
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,600
back to the app idea?

534
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,840
Or is it just that on a desktop
nobody understood the

535
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,905
concept of having an app that
actually is in web standards?

536
00:20:04,905 --> 00:20:09,490

537
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:11,470
PAUL KINLAN: I don't know what
the official answer is, but

538
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:13,870
it's like just generally
widget was a

539
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:15,400
weird word, for one.

540
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,920
It didn't denote anything like
an installable application for

541
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,500
me at least when I was
looking at it.

542
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,110
BRIAN LEROUX: I believe they're
an evangelism team.

543
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:25,950

544
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:28,854
AUDIENCE: At the time somebody
begged them to change the

545
00:20:28,854 --> 00:20:30,320
stupid name.

546
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:30,790
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

547
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:33,210
If you look at the spec, a lot
of this stuff is very similar

548
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:36,790
across all the manifests that we
have apart from it's an XML

549
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,040
and not in the JavaScript
notation.

550
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,710

551
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,880
It's kind of interesting.

552
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,890
CHRIS HEILMANN: So one question
that people had was,

553
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:49,710
now that every single app
platform, like packaged app

554
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:52,810
platform in HTML has a different
manifest file, is

555
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:55,480
there a way to actually
automate that?

556
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,900
Is there already a script
out there--

557
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,306
PAUL KINLAN: appmator.com.

558
00:20:57,306 --> 00:20:59,290
CHRIS HEILMANN: --to generate
all of them?

559
00:20:59,290 --> 00:20:59,560
PAUL KINLAN: Yep.

560
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,920
We made one called Appmator
which did Chrome apps, that

561
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,210
was very specific to Chrome apps
but Firefox apps aren't

562
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:05,710
too dissimilar.

563
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:08,060
I think, Bruce, you had one?

564
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:08,530
Or you--

565
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:11,722
AUDIENCE: Scott Wilson from
Apache Project had--

566
00:21:11,722 --> 00:21:12,178
PAUL KINLAN: OK.

567
00:21:12,178 --> 00:21:13,550
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
translate Chrome.

568
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:13,625
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

569
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:16,290
There's been a couple of these
ones where the core

570
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,720
functionality in most
of the browsers is

571
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,830
pretty much the same.

572
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,960
We are diverging now a little
bit where we're starting to

573
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,240
get more hardware access.

574
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,640
But we're still, as an industry,
exploring what that

575
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,560
means and kind of what
that entails.

576
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,740
But yeah, we've had the ability
to kind of convert

577
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:32,850
between them but I've not seen
a huge appetite for it.

578
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:35,230
BRIAN LEROUX: We've got a
library called Confetti in the

579
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:37,470
PhoneGap project that
will spit out all

580
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,610
the different formats.

581
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:42,990
So instead of trying to push
an agenda on one format, we

582
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:44,864
just decided we would
support all of them.

583
00:21:44,864 --> 00:21:48,040

584
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,430
CHRIS HEILMANN: It's interesting
because the apps

585
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:51,090
themselves are they
that different?

586
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:54,460
It's like, can you just build
one app and just render it on

587
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,550
all the different platforms?

588
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:58,580
Because if we're not
inter-compatible in HTML5

589
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:02,530
itself, then we can not really
tell the native clients off

590
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,030
that they're on.

591
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,710
DIANA CHENG: Besides from the
manifest format, I don't know.

592
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,360
I mean, the technologies
are the same.

593
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,680
It's a package directory.

594
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:14,080
And I think since Alex is at the
front that maybe this is

595
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,560
something that TAG could
address, like the

596
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,310
fragmentation, in terms
of packaging format.

597
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:25,880
It's a long term problem in the
W3C and it would be good

598
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,000
to find solutions.

599
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,370
BRIAN LEROUX: Save the
internet, Alex.

600
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:31,470
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

601
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:36,120
Yeah so we've got different APIs
at the moment as well.

602
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,750
Fundamentally, I think Mozilla's
got the web API

603
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:40,430
system and we've got our
own Chrome name space.

604
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:42,470
Until that kind of settles down
and we know exactly what

605
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:45,860
we need from APIs.

606
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,400
A normal web application, like
something that you would

607
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,200
expect to get in your browser
but that's got a little bit of

608
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,440
installability and all this type
of stuff, we've probably

609
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,260
got broadly compatible across
a lot of these platforms.

610
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:59,560
It's when you get to these new
bits like UDP, TCP, USB,

611
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,700
Bluetooth, these things that
people want from their native

612
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,370
applications, but we don't
have access to

613
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:05,430
them inside the browser.

614
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:07,130
We have to work on that
all together.

615
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:08,400
CHRIS HEILMANN: Shouldn't
they already want to?

616
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,450
Isn't the big problem that I
can't take a photo at the

617
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:13,130
moment across browsers?

618
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:15,190
Aren't we already thinking about
the hard projects where

619
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:17,770
we don't even have parity with
native apps at the moment?

620
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:18,950
PAUL KINLAN: I mean, the latest
browsers we can take

621
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:21,670
photos and we can save
them in the gallery.

622
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:22,600
We can do these things.

623
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,110
We might have not done a greater
job at evangelizing

624
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:25,610
these bits--

625
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:28,190
CHRIS HEILMANN: Well then,
do it in the iPhone.

626
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,050
PAUL KINLAN: You can, in the
latest one, I think.

627
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:30,470
BRIAN LEROUX: You can.

628
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:31,530
Media capture is there.

629
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:32,260
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

630
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:32,770
Input type.

631
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:34,810
BRIAN LEROUX: It's [INAUDIBLE]
user media but it's input type

632
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:35,710
in the camera.

633
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,530
It declared [INAUDIBLE].

634
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,880
CHRIS HEILMANN: OK.

635
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,950
Question there?

636
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:40,490
AUDIENCE: Yes.

637
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:42,050
[? Jonas Sicking ?]

638
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,130
from Mozilla.

639
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,970
I've done a lot of work on that
platform for Firefox OS

640
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:48,620
including the web
APIs and so on.

641
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,590
One of the reasons we don't have
compatible manifests, is

642
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,500
that we haven't actually
tried.

643
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,960
The device API group went off
and did all the APIs but it's

644
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,100
kind of like they came at it
from the wrong way of not

645
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:03,190
doing the runtime first which
is why there was no common

646
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:06,450
ground to sort of build these
things on top of it.

647
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:09,510
The sys apps working group is
the first real time we're

648
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:12,780
actually trying to standardize
the packaging format, the

649
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,950
runtime model.

650
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:19,730
There are proposals a couple
of them including one from

651
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:23,800
Mozilla for defining a
standardized manifest and

652
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,900
packaging format and so on.

653
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,390
I also wanted, since I
have the microphone--

654
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:31,260

655
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:35,180
the app model in Firefox
OS is absolutely not

656
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,860
packaged apps only.

657
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:41,420
We do a lot to enable web
applications to run just like

658
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:45,345
a normal website runs today, but
as much as possible enable

659
00:24:45,345 --> 00:24:48,170
it offline, which it's not quite
there yet but we are

660
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:49,360
hoping to get it there.

661
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,460
BRIAN LEROUX: I honestly don't
think it's an issue either.

662
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,070
It's just a metafile format.

663
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:56,510
And it's kind of the
most boring bits.

664
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:59,130
The permissions is going to be
the thing that needs be solved

665
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:02,450
and the rest of it's like
where's your app icons and

666
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:04,870
what's the title on the
springboard and that type of

667
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:05,830
thing which is--

668
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:06,700
PAUL KINLAN: There's also the
point that [? Jonas ?]

669
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,160
mentioned a second
ago is offline.

670
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,350
That was like the very first
thing that we tried to do in

671
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,390
the next version of Chrome Maps
is make sure the offline

672
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:15,760
is kind of deep like baked in
completely, which means that

673
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,630
we've gone away on that side of
things from like the hosted

674
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:20,690
model right now.

675
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:22,110
But we thought that was the
biggest thing because if you

676
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:27,290
move into phones and iPad,
iPhone, and Android, it's a

677
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:28,070
different development model.

678
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,680
You're offline straight away and
then you need [? to put ?]

679
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,440
online functionality
into your app.

680
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,050
And we believe that, at least
for installable apps right

681
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:37,010
now, that's the way we
should be going.

682
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:39,960
CHRIS HEILMANN: One question
here is, to go back into the

683
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:44,150
UX what everybody asked about,
how do we ensure that people

684
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:47,760
know the impact of what
they're granting?

685
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,700
How do we make sure that people
don't go through the

686
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,200
Android way of like yeah,
yeah, yeah, I give you

687
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,870
everything because I want to
throw these birds at those

688
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:56,120
pigs or whatever?

689
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,870

690
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:00,370
Isn't it the problem
that we have?

691
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:02,880
Like already the press is saying
that HTML5 will never

692
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,610
be secure and native is secure
and when we start actually

693
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:07,830
advertising like, yeah, there's
things you shouldn't

694
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,780
give grant access to.

695
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:14,250
Would there be a bad backlash
towards the platform?

696
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:16,560
BRIAN LEROUX: It's an education
issue absolutely.

697
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,700
We have to teach people what
these things mean.

698
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,160
And I think we're going to have
to teach people how to

699
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,760
use their devices in
a responsible way.

700
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,740
And that's probably going to,
unfortunately, take a massive

701
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:29,980
privacy fail before we can truly
appreciate how important

702
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:32,280
these things are.

703
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,590
DIANA CHENG: One thing that many
people claim, and that I

704
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:37,640
actually agree for
certain APIs is

705
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,360
through keeping the locality.

706
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,250
So the relationship between the
permission and the action

707
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:45,440
that needs this permission makes
it clearer to the user.

708
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,760
So having an API that allows you
to specify up front for a

709
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,970
website or web app what are all
of the permissions and for

710
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:56,240
the user to approve them in a
batch might not be the best

711
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,250
for all applications.

712
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:59,920
It could work in many cases.

713
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,890
If I just want your
location, then why

714
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:05,590
would I ask this upfront?

715
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:10,380
I want to be asked for this when
I actually want to see my

716
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:13,230
location with relation to
my car in a map, right?

717
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:16,010
So that helps the
user, I think.

718
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:16,720
CHRIS HEILMANN: Well,
that's the power of

719
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,390
the web, isn't it?

720
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:20,520
The immediacy and the on demand
delivery of content and

721
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,340
on demand delivery
of functionality.

722
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,280
Whereas, with packaged
apps and native apps,

723
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,370
we don't have that.

724
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:28,020
It's like one app per thing
that does it perfectly.

725
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:31,810
That's fine but I have to
install an app to convert

726
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:34,730
Celsius and Fahrenheit where I
could enter that in Google in

727
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:37,940
the search bar as well and
get the same result.

728
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:42,920
So the question is, how do we
make people aware that the web

729
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,500
apps can't do more than that?

730
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,060
With packaged apps, don't we
just simulate what the other

731
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,540
apps are doing but we don't
have the same access to

732
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:53,690
hardware and we can't give
the same experience?

733
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:56,050
BRIAN LEROUX: Well, with the
PhoneGap hack we're just

734
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:58,040
utilizing what the operating
system does.

735
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,450
So in the case of Apple,
the security

736
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:01,940
model is to be reviewed.

737
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:04,630
In the case of Android, the
security model is to have a

738
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:06,640
permissions manifest.

739
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,480
And then that's all we can do.

740
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,540
Chrome apps, Windows 8 apps,
all these new web operating

741
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:18,050
systems, Firefox OS, this is the
opportunity to define this

742
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:19,510
and teach people.

743
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:24,490
So basically what I'm saying is,
that's your guys' problem.

744
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:27,030
CHRIS HEILMANN: Because the
issue is I scare a lot of

745
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:30,180
users off when I just show
them like I want to have

746
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,390
access to 20 things.

747
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:33,180
This app can do this
and that and that.

748
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:38,530
Whereas, if the usage of the app
is basic and later on they

749
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:41,050
go to other levels and
need more access.

750
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:43,670
And then, the question
should come.

751
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:45,640
But that's again, a UX
problem, isn't it?

752
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,850
PAUL KINLAN: I don't know.

753
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:49,640
You have to work it out.

754
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,400
It's actually a really complex
problem because you've got

755
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,100
different times that you might
want elevated access, like the

756
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,570
unlimited storage one is we can
let you know at install

757
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:01,040
time that this application's
got unlimited storage.

758
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,240
I don't think we do at the
moment for that one, but there

759
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,290
are other ones like when you can
do cross domain requests

760
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:08,450
without breaking out the normal
site, like the sandbox,

761
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:10,590
like the domain isolation
at least.

762
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:12,620
We let you know at install time
that this application can

763
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:15,650
do that, but it all depends
on the message that we do.

764
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:17,780
If you put one or two sites
in, we'll tell you you can

765
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:20,360
access Twitter.com, it
can access Facebook.

766
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,940
But if you put 10 different
like domain sources in, we

767
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:27,000
basically say this application
can access the

768
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,710
content of your sites.

769
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:29,860
Because you can't list all 20.

770
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:32,220
And especially when it's like
a weird regular expression

771
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:35,270
which is *.Facebook.com/*.

772
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:37,850
Like normal users aren't going
to even know what that means.

773
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:39,400
They're just going to see some
weird stuff when they install

774
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,110
it which increases the
likelihood that they'll just

775
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:47,310
click OK without understanding
the ramifications.

776
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,960
AUDIENCE: I believe greatly in
the belief you should give

777
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,560
control to users.

778
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:55,040
This is a question regarding
to the permission system.

779
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:59,340
So I'm wondering about the
problem with education

780
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,760
regarding the user.

781
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,920
The problem I see is that
there's no control to use

782
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,240
actually at the moment.

783
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,180
Users giving a question
regarding giving access to all

784
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:13,310
of these permissions without
[INAUDIBLE] actually giving

785
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:17,590
updates set on the specific
permissions.

786
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,660
They don't wan to give access
to contacts, for example.

787
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:22,220
I think that should
be possible.

788
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:22,710
CHRIS HEILMANN: Yeah.

789
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:26,490
The question is you have to give
all permissions and if

790
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:28,860
you don't give one of them, you
just don't get the app,

791
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,950
rather than it should be up to
you which ones to give and the

792
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:34,200
app should apply to that or
the app should change

793
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,290
accordingly?

794
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:36,520
BRIAN LEROUX: I think Chrome
got this [INAUDIBLE].

795
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,300
PAUL KINLAN: We're exploring
that at the moment where you

796
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,640
can request access.

797
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,450
Basically, it's an optional
permission where you can

798
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:43,190
request access.

799
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:45,690
You have it in the manifest so
you know the application's at

800
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:47,010
least going to ask for
it at some point.

801
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:51,850
And then when you come to ask
for it, you can ask the user

802
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,500
are they sure they want
to do this action.

803
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,290
I think the problem it comes
down to is, one, it's

804
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:58,240
relatively awkward to tell
developers to go and do this

805
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,780
and the easier one is just to
put the non-optional optional

806
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:03,840
permissions in.

807
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,870
It all depends on the
functionality

808
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:05,500
of the app as well.

809
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,810
If the app can live with
it, then it's fine.

810
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:09,480
If it can't live with it, what's
the point of installing

811
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,920
the app if you need access to
the camera and then every so

812
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,320
often you don't give access
to the camera.

813
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,090
I don't quite know.

814
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:16,480
CHRIS HEILMANN: In Firefox
OS, we've got

815
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,370
three different levels.

816
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:19,910
We've got an app that you host
yourself which only has access

817
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:22,040
to the things that the browser
has in there now as well like

818
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,930
local storage and geolocation.

819
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:26,730
And then we have an app that
has to go through the

820
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:29,700
marketplace and we have an app
that only Mozilla and partners

821
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,340
can do that get access to like
telephony and sending text

822
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,840
messages and things.

823
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,560
Is that a good idea or is it
maybe something other people

824
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,420
should mimic?

825
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:42,960
Because the one size fits all,
that app can access everything

826
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,160
or nothing, is not getting us
anywhere at the moment.

827
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,740
People want to host things on
their own server but they also

828
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,680
want to get access
to the hardware.

829
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,900
BRIAN LEROUX: I like
that model too.

830
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,050
I think these things
are compatible.

831
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:58,260
If people happen to be running
Chrome right now, you could

832
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:02,390
click on the favicon icon, and
you can get this contacts menu

833
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:04,460
in your desktop browser that
shows you all these different

834
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:04,990
permissions.

835
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:07,550
And I think this is the early
manifestation of these ideas,

836
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,250
but it is an all or nothing.

837
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:12,050
You don't have this idea of
different levels of privilege,

838
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:17,130
the system apps, user apps, wild
west apps, I guess, would

839
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:19,350
be the third part.

840
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:22,350
And then there's like the idea
of federation in app stores.

841
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:26,440
So right now app stores are all
walled gardens per vendor,

842
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,910
essentially, but it
makes no sense.

843
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:32,610
Why is EA getting permission
from Apple to ship a game?

844
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:33,700
It's crazy, right?

845
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,920
EA should have its own store.

846
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,570
I trust EA.

847
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:37,330
I want to play games.

848
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,650
CHRIS HEILMANN: Well if only we
had an open marketplace API

849
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:41,260
but I'm not going to talk about
that now, but you can

850
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:44,130
ask me later.

851
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,630
What is interesting about this
is that you said like I trust

852
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:48,300
EA, but you can't trust
any server.

853
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,400
It doesn't really matter
who it is.

854
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,980
It's like larger companies
can get their

855
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,100
service hacked as well.

856
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,570
It's just a matter of
how do you do it

857
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:59,320
unless you host it yourself?

858
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,890
And that, to me, is the main
crux of the matter.

859
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:05,510
I just got an update on an
Android app that asked me for

860
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:08,090
1.81 gig update.

861
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:10,120
And you're like, you haven't
understood mobile devices, did

862
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,860
you because I only got 8 gig
on this machine anyway.

863
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:17,710
So how could we do an app that
are already granted access to

864
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:21,410
allow it to update
automatically, to only get

865
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:24,600
parts, to load a new level, to
load to new extra in a game

866
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,250
rather than replace the whole
packaging system?

867
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:29,460
I think that is failing
on the web.

868
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,210
I don't want to download
an app every

869
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:32,520
time there is a change.

870
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,850
But the change should be in
an extra API somehow.

871
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:38,060
BRIAN LEROUX: That's an
imperative API for the cache

872
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,260
manifest would do that.

873
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:42,150
So you could do delta updating
which I think is the stuff

874
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:44,860
that Alex and Jake have
been proposing.

875
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:45,430
Yeah.

876
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:46,230
It's a big issue.

877
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:48,540
So PhoneGap apps have this
one all the time.

878
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:51,920
We have a game and that game
could be gigabytes.

879
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,990
They only want to load the first
level because you want

880
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:56,080
to be available over the network
and if the user gets

881
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,090
to level two in whatever game
they're playing, then download

882
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:01,400
those assets then.

883
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,320
It's a huge issue for sure.

884
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:07,090

885
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:08,560
AUDIENCE: I think when we were
talking on the permission

886
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,300
stuff, I can give a very short
run down on what we're doing

887
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:18,330
in Firefox OS, which is we
essentially have two types of

888
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:19,670
privileges for APIs.

889
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:22,889
We have APIs where the user gets
asked the question very

890
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:27,780
similar to GPS and
geolocation.

891
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:30,090
But there's a lot of APIs where
we just can't ask the

892
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:32,788
user, like asking the user do
you want to allow this app to

893
00:34:32,788 --> 00:34:33,639
use TCP socket?

894
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:35,790
It doesn't mean anything.

895
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:38,510
So for those types of APIs where
we didn't feel we could

896
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:43,560
ask the user, we have to do it
through a review process which

897
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,239
is very unfortunate.

898
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:48,420
Because it does mean that it's
much more similar to the iOS

899
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:52,350
model where it has to be someone
that is a trusted

900
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:54,260
party that has actually
done code reviews.

901
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,590
Code reviews doesn't really work
but it's kind of the only

902
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,790
thing we have right now.

903
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:01,800
We sort of have a third model
where it has to go both

904
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,110
through code review and we ask
the user where the code review

905
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:07,310
sort of covers the security
aspect and the asking the user

906
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:10,350
covers the privacy aspect.

907
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:13,170
But these are sort of
the models we have.

908
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:16,140
The code review part does mean
that it has to be a packaged

909
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,850
app because that's the only
way to ensure that the

910
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:21,920
reviewed code is what's actually
being executed.

911
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,040
But that's something we'd like
to figure out but this is the

912
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,080
first iteration.

913
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,010
CHRIS HEILMANN: One question
also on moderator was an

914
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:33,780
interesting one that says, I
trust the cam app from Google.

915
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:37,510
Why don't we have apps that are
trusted for the access and

916
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:40,030
go through those rather
than having

917
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:42,550
the app itself contacted?

918
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:45,040
I don't want to put the dagger
in but Web Intents did

919
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,420
something like that,
didn't it?

920
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:50,165
Because I already knew I had
stuff on my mobile phone that

921
00:35:50,165 --> 00:35:51,210
I could take pictures with.

922
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:54,140
Why can't I get the picture
from that app rather than

923
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:58,240
having to ask for permission
to access the camera?

924
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,730
Web activities do that, and in
the browser, input type camera

925
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:02,800
does the same thing.

926
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,780
But an app cannot access it
the same way as far as I

927
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,290
understand it.

928
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:10,160
Wouldn't that be a way around
that every operating system

929
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,500
comes with apps that are trusted
for different access

930
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,860
to different parts and
it goes through a

931
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:17,970
security level that way?

932
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:19,780
BRIAN LEROUX: Do it, Paul.

933
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,500
Go.

934
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,350
PAUL KINLAN: I actually
don't know the answer.

935
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:25,980
People want natively integrated
experiences like

936
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:26,610
inside their app.

937
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:28,490
They would like the camera to
be there so that they can

938
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:30,580
apply a little fish-eye effect
to it and make their face look

939
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:33,260
big and all these types of
things in real time.

940
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:36,630
And we could go down the Intent
model of you delegate

941
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,620
the functionality to a
trusted application.

942
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:41,490
That's fine, but people want
to integrate it into their

943
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,140
experience, and I don't
know how you delegate

944
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,520
between both scenarios.

945
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,740
Maybe have an activity
Intent-like system at

946
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,145
the same time as--

947
00:36:49,145 --> 00:36:49,630
I don't know.

948
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,730
I think people get confused by
having to switch between apps

949
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:53,110
all the time.

950
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,360
If you're having all
this functionality.

951
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,308

952
00:36:57,308 --> 00:36:58,020
I don't know.

953
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,980
You've got to get broad
consensus across every single

954
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,800
different type of platform
about well

955
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,780
how do I access contacts?

956
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:05,990
Do I go to the contact kind
of like contact manager?

957
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,410
Well, obviously if we have 10
different types of contact

958
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:08,743
managers, it's a desktop
machine and all

959
00:37:08,743 --> 00:37:11,845
this type of stuff.

960
00:37:11,845 --> 00:37:12,330
I don't know.

961
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:13,580
CHRIS HEILMANN: Especially
with contacts it's an

962
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:17,510
interesting one because the
interface is optimized for

963
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:20,280
doing contacts so why should
any app build their own

964
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,620
contact manager on
top of that?

965
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:23,820
PAUL KINLAN: Well it's not
necessarily contact manager.

966
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:28,630
It's like people want to share
invites to their friends on

967
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:30,120
different networks and all
this type of stuff.

968
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,230
There's loads of different use
cases where you want to

969
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:38,070
integrate it directly into the
experience and that's why you

970
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:39,370
don't delegate out.

971
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:40,300
CHRIS HEILMANN: We had
a twitch over there.

972
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,559
Munir, did you want
to say something?

973
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:44,545
MUNIR: Yeah.

974
00:37:44,545 --> 00:37:45,795
[INAUDIBLE].

975
00:37:45,795 --> 00:37:48,000

976
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,580
CHRIS HEILMANN: As you see in
the Firefox tee shirt, he

977
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:52,936
actually works on the
web APIs as well.

978
00:37:52,936 --> 00:37:54,424
MUNIR: [INAUDIBLE].

979
00:37:54,424 --> 00:37:57,950
So I'd actually [INAUDIBLE]
exactly solving the issue you

980
00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:00,050
are mentioning.

981
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:03,590
If an app can't do something,
[INAUDIBLE] are doing

982
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:06,780
something, permissions or
something, like sending an SMS

983
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:10,790
in Firefox OS, only the
system can do that.

984
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:15,226
You can just call that web
[INAUDIBLE] and system app

985
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:19,440
already has some behavior that
is secure like showing the

986
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,140
[INAUDIBLE].

987
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:23,485
So all activity should
resolve [INAUDIBLE]

988
00:38:23,485 --> 00:38:26,250
where not want to
do some issue.

989
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:28,776
Web Intent has [INAUDIBLE]

990
00:38:28,776 --> 00:38:30,628
or Intent on Android.

991
00:38:30,628 --> 00:38:33,880

992
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,200
CHRIS HEILMANN: Another
question we had, what

993
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,030
granularity should permissions
be at?

994
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:39,400
Obviously having separate
permissions for app cache and

995
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,400
local storage is overkill,
but do we need any

996
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,510
granularity at all?

997
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:46,290
Would a single privilege status
be enough, like can

998
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,890
take photos, can't take live
video, for example?

999
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:51,560

1000
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:54,270
Shall we complicate this more
than it is already?

1001
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:56,570
DIANA CHENG: I was going to say
granularity makes UI very

1002
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:57,300
complicated.

1003
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,800
And that's something we want
to avoid because developers

1004
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,700
don't like presenting
prompts to the user.

1005
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,030
That has been proven.

1006
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,390
They want to avoid it.

1007
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:12,240
So the more complicated the UI,
the least developers are

1008
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,640
going to want to use
any APIs really.

1009
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:15,860
PETRO SOININEN: Yeah.

1010
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:18,840
I think it comes down to what
Paul said earlier that if you

1011
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:22,980
start having gazillion lines
in your prompt asking about

1012
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:25,340
cryptic things no one is
going to understand

1013
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,140
what it actually means.

1014
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:31,240
So there has to be a way to
try to keep it simple and

1015
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,350
actually understandable
for the user.

1016
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:34,760
CHRIS HEILMANN: It's an
interesting task for the UX

1017
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,790
people out there, isn't it?

1018
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,160
It's like how to explain
something that complex in very

1019
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,990
simple words and then translate
it into foreign

1020
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:41,420
languages as well.

1021
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:41,606
PETRO SOININEN: Yeah.

1022
00:39:41,606 --> 00:39:44,620
Plus when you take into account
potential kind of

1023
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,560
different legislation
in some areas.

1024
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,950
For example, in China you might
have totally different

1025
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:52,310
requirements on what kind of
privacy things you actually

1026
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:54,015
need to ask from the user.

1027
00:39:54,015 --> 00:39:55,970
And for example, if you
use the same service

1028
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:58,290
in Germany or whatever.

1029
00:39:58,290 --> 00:39:58,430
CHRIS HEILMANN: Yeah.

1030
00:39:58,430 --> 00:39:59,870
PETRO SOININEN: Quite
a complex issue.

1031
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:01,190
CHRIS HEILMANN: You can't ask
for gender in Germany, for

1032
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,470
example, these kinds
of things.

1033
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:04,730
Yeah.

1034
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:07,630
DIANA CHENG: When it should
arise is also what happens

1035
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,450
when the application changes.

1036
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:13,690
When the application gets
changed, if it needs a higher

1037
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:16,180
level or a more specific
level of granularity.

1038
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:21,320
For example, for your location,
we thought OK,

1039
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,560
asking for the exact location
all the time when only the

1040
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,390
city is relevant.

1041
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:26,770
It's too much.

1042
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:30,480
Why shouldn't we ask for just
city, country, whatever?

1043
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,740
Then what happens when the
app actually needs more

1044
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:33,380
information?

1045
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:36,660
They need to prompt
the user again.

1046
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:43,010
Or for a different action in the
same app, 15 minutes later

1047
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:46,040
then you are prompting the user
again for a more specific

1048
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,890
permission and that's
not good.

1049
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:48,960
CHRIS HEILMANN: It's
tricky, isn't it?

1050
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,050
It all [INAUDIBLE]

1051
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:52,170
to me it seems like we're not
going to solve this one here,

1052
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:56,440
but I love the idea of any app
having access to a permissions

1053
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,510
controller that actually would
control all the permissions

1054
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:02,830
possible and actually allow you
to unset, set them, get

1055
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:06,060
new permissions in, and
basically separate that from

1056
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,100
your main app.

1057
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,350
Because right now, we have to
bake it in somehow and that

1058
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:11,250
just feels like it
doesn't scale and

1059
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:13,670
it's not future proof.

1060
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:16,370
Has anybody thought of that?

1061
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:18,140
BRIAN LEROUX: Yeah and it's also
really closely tied to a

1062
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,170
capability model.

1063
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:22,050
So this is another problem that
we're running into pretty

1064
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:26,715
often where we'll have devices
that don't have a camera and

1065
00:41:26,715 --> 00:41:30,600
someone will ship an app in an
app store and that app will

1066
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,170
utilize camera functionality.

1067
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:37,640
And right now our answer
is that we just fail.

1068
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,820
CHRIS HEILMANN: Trying to detect
a camera that isn't

1069
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,140
there unless you ship
it with the app.

1070
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,016
BRIAN LEROUX: Right.

1071
00:41:42,016 --> 00:41:43,330
Yeah.

1072
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:45,900
Buy this app, get
a free camera.

1073
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,350
AUDIENCE: Just an observation
about granularity

1074
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:50,030
permissions, really.

1075
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:53,140
It seems that there's no
value in asking a user

1076
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,855
can I use index TB?

1077
00:41:54,855 --> 00:41:56,250
Can I use local storage?

1078
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:58,660
Can I use app cache?

1079
00:41:58,660 --> 00:41:59,820
Because they don't care.

1080
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:03,060
But then something we thought
about in Opera was with like

1081
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,290
geolocation.

1082
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:07,360
So we could imagine, for
example, that somebody like a

1083
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:11,080
woman living on her own might
wish to say yeah my tweets can

1084
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:15,380
have my location between 10:00
AM and 6:00 PM but I don't

1085
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:17,965
want my tweets to have my
location after 6:00 PM because

1086
00:42:17,965 --> 00:42:19,330
I'm probably at my house.

1087
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:21,473
CHRIS HEILMANN: So Geo-Fencing
that Flickr has?

1088
00:42:21,473 --> 00:42:21,866
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1089
00:42:21,866 --> 00:42:22,260
Yeah.

1090
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:26,700
And one of the things that we
looked at as well about a

1091
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:29,220
console where you
can look at the

1092
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:31,960
permissions you've granted.

1093
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:36,730
You very rarely want to see what
permissions did I give to

1094
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:39,150
mrspanky.de,
for example.

1095
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:41,280
But you might very well--

1096
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,240
sorry, Brian--

1097
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,990
you might very well want
to say what things

1098
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:47,950
can look at my camera?

1099
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:52,180
So the question of which way
around the grid goes.

1100
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,210
You probably care.

1101
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:53,940
Oh, shit!

1102
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:57,200
What can look at my camera much
more than what have I

1103
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,510
given every individual URL
or app, for example.

1104
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:02,690
And there's also with a camera,
of course, there's an

1105
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:05,560
argument for having a big
kill switch so nothing

1106
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,740
can look at my camera.

1107
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:09,910
Because obviously you cover the
camera on your phone or

1108
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:13,200
your laptop, but there's no
guarantee that it isn't

1109
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,815
actually a camera that's out of
reach that's plugged into

1110
00:43:15,815 --> 00:43:19,612
your laptop and you might want
to have a kill thing.

1111
00:43:19,612 --> 00:43:21,310
PAUL KINLAN: So one of the
interesting things about that

1112
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:23,880
is I don't know whether we're
assuming that these

1113
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:27,050
applications run inside the
browser, but a lot of the

1114
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:28,820
stuff that especially we're
doing with Chrome applications

1115
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:31,770
is that you don't know they're
actually even slightly tied to

1116
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:33,180
Chrome in the slightest.

1117
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:35,280
So if you're going to have a
permissions model, you're not

1118
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,440
going to put it inside your
browser for someone to go in

1119
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,370
there and disable it.

1120
00:43:38,370 --> 00:43:42,270
And I don't know what type of
operating system level.

1121
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:43,530
We don't control
Windows, right?

1122
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:44,750
So we couldn't put that in.

1123
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,690
So we have to go and add a
settings app, for instance, if

1124
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:51,125
we're going to do that type
of thing it's hard.

1125
00:43:51,125 --> 00:43:52,590
Yeah, just hard.

1126
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:54,380
CHRIS HEILMANN: Which brings
us to this one here.

1127
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:57,020
What do packaged apps with their
close ties to particular

1128
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:59,670
browsers and web app stores mean
for cross browser as a

1129
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:01,460
platform support?

1130
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:05,030
As I said before, it's like we
always say in HTML5 you write

1131
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:06,940
it once and it works everywhere
and then like

1132
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:09,690
actually that app store doesn't
allow you to do that,

1133
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:11,370
that one doesn't allow
you to do that.

1134
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:13,930
So can't we all just
get along?

1135
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:16,820

1136
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,970
When PhoneGap came out,
it said clearly

1137
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:20,180
this is a gap solution.

1138
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:22,770
We want to be redundant sooner
or later and it's been now

1139
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:23,420
four years?

1140
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:24,670
BRIAN LEROUX: Yeah.

1141
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:26,440

1142
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:26,730
Yep.

1143
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:27,960
PAUL KINLAN: But what's
it mean for

1144
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,180
across browser support?

1145
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:31,090
That's the question I've got.

1146
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:34,230
If you've package this thing
up to be a deliverable--

1147
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:35,050
it's like Adobe AIR, right?

1148
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:36,800
When you could package a
[INAUDIBLE] on JavaScript it

1149
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,830
would run with a really
old version of WebKit.

1150
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:41,640
Does the user know?

1151
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:42,210
Does the user care?

1152
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:44,420
Would they know it's Firefox and
not Firefox that's ruling

1153
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:46,130
the renderer?

1154
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:47,910
If you've got installable apps,
there are installable

1155
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:50,430
apps which are technically
isolated from the browser.

1156
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:51,780
I don't know.

1157
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:53,520
And if you talk about things
inside the browser, then

1158
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,410
that's a different
question again.

1159
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:56,610
BRIAN LEROUX: I think with
renderer things have gotten

1160
00:44:56,610 --> 00:45:00,270
pretty clean at this point
because of one of the, I

1161
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:03,320
think, biggest triumphs of HTML5
was defining the parser.

1162
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:06,430
So now all browsers have the
same bugs and we don't need to

1163
00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:09,800
worry about cross browser
compatibility.

1164
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,960
This is just the new
part that's going

1165
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:12,820
to be tough to do.

1166
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:15,110
And there's probably going to be
a jQuery of device APIs at

1167
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:16,670
some point I would assume.

1168
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:18,530
And we're going to have
something that's going to

1169
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:20,285
polyfill all this garbage
and then eventually

1170
00:45:20,285 --> 00:45:21,650
standardize that too.

1171
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:21,980
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

1172
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:23,130
People are doing it
with Node, right?

1173
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:25,760
So people are building these
Node-based servers which can

1174
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,400
talk to AR drones and then go
well I want that to work on,

1175
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,050
like a Chrome app.

1176
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:31,800
I want it to work on
the Firefox app.

1177
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,600
Well, we'll just port the Node
APIs back across rather than

1178
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,370
go and try and learn
the default--

1179
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:37,180
BRIAN LEROUX: Browser find.

1180
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:37,650
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

1181
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:42,010
Actually, we use browser find
in our project so it's cool.

1182
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:44,130
CHRIS HEILMANN: One question
we also had is why can't I

1183
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:49,640
trust Open Full Screen without
the user having to give me

1184
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,710
permission and the keyboard
access in Full Screen and all

1185
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:53,650
the things we had?

1186
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:56,270
That also ties into why can't I
have a video playing in the

1187
00:45:56,270 --> 00:45:57,580
background on iOS?

1188
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:59,465
Why it is click to activate?

1189
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:02,590

1190
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:05,470
Education-wise, we probably know
why all of these things

1191
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:06,200
are necessary.

1192
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,620
But it is a valid question
for end users.

1193
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:11,270
Why do I get this ugly window
saying this app is now full

1194
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:15,480
screen because yeah, it's an
app, I want it full screen.

1195
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,680
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

1196
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,150
It's all based on usage and
use cases and developers

1197
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:21,290
actually wanting these
things, right?

1198
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:23,260
And we didn't prioritize
that originally.

1199
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:25,790
We've added it in so that you
can request a window goes full

1200
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:28,250
screen without any kind
of interstitial.

1201
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:29,290
But it's an installed app.

1202
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:30,590
It's a different thing.

1203
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:33,770
And I don't know whether the
access model from the web

1204
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:36,680
translates to installed apps the
same way, where we have to

1205
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:42,370
have an explicit user gesture
for activities such as across

1206
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:43,180
a site and it just going

1207
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:44,235
automatically to a full screen.

1208
00:46:44,235 --> 00:46:45,540
You don't want that on
the drive by web.

1209
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:47,490
But as an installed app,
you're probably fine.

1210
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:50,970
You want your game
full screen.

1211
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:51,141
BRIAN LEROUX: Yeah.

1212
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:52,640
It's to avoid fishing.

1213
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,680
Essentially because that screen
app could then fake

1214
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,173
your Chrome.

1215
00:46:56,173 --> 00:47:00,490
It could say, hey, you forget
to put in your bank path.

1216
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:01,810
CHRIS HEILMANN: I think the
best I've ever seen was a

1217
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:04,080
banner that said has your credit
card being stolen?

1218
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:07,180
Please enter your credit
card details here.

1219
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:08,550
That was amazing.

1220
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:11,750
I totally loved that.

1221
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:15,320
So what do you think about
a model that allows you a

1222
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:19,500
certain amount, like you can
store five photos without

1223
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,280
asking for permission.

1224
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:25,440
Is that a possibility that we
have tried to buy permissions

1225
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,250
and then when they like it, it
seems like you want to store

1226
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:29,320
bigger photos.

1227
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:33,860
Please give us access to the
rest of the hardware.

1228
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:34,810
BRIAN LEROUX: Super
case by case.

1229
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,460
But yeah, I like it.

1230
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:37,470
I think it's good.

1231
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:40,490
And this is, for me, also one
of the fundamental issues is

1232
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:41,980
offline storage.

1233
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:44,650
Right now we've got 2 to 5
megs depending on who you

1234
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:47,920
believe which isn't enough
space to do anything

1235
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:48,710
significant.

1236
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:52,030
And so yeah, I think we do
need these piecemeal

1237
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:55,370
permissions to ease people
into the hot tub of it.

1238
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:55,700
Right?

1239
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:56,930
We got to get the
stuff into the

1240
00:47:56,930 --> 00:47:59,700
browser as soon as possible.

1241
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:00,680
CHRIS HEILMANN: How
about storage?

1242
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:03,270
I mean, I don't want to go into
index DB versus web SQL.

1243
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:05,105
I'd tell people to
use Lawnchair.

1244
00:48:05,105 --> 00:48:11,410
But it's still an issue that
people don't go into web app

1245
00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:13,320
development because they
basically say, I don't want to

1246
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,470
write for 10 different things.

1247
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:17,920
Why can't your browser
vendors get along?

1248
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,200
So what could be an
answer to that?

1249
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:20,870
Use Lawnchair.

1250
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:22,120
Yeah, I know.

1251
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:25,950

1252
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:26,150
BRIAN LEROUX: Yeah.

1253
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:27,640
Use Lawnchair-- no, I don't know
what the answer is there.

1254
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:29,786
I think the browser vendors now
work together more than

1255
00:48:29,786 --> 00:48:30,770
they ever have.

1256
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:33,470
The new browser war is
essentially consensus.

1257
00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:35,520
That's the new battle that's
happening and it's

1258
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,020
speed and dev tools.

1259
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:40,330
Those are the things that the
browsers are fighting about.

1260
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:42,820
So we're winning as devs but
there's just all these things

1261
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:45,130
and storage is one of
them that the native

1262
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:47,070
world kicks our ass.

1263
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:48,320
We need to fix that.

1264
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:51,350

1265
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:53,090
CHRIS HEILMANN: OK.

1266
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:53,790
Any last words?

1267
00:48:53,790 --> 00:48:55,040
We're almost out of time.

1268
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,490

1269
00:48:57,490 --> 00:48:58,240
Give us a timeline.

1270
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,390
When can we finally have
packaged apps that work

1271
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:01,360
everywhere?

1272
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,400
When can you close PhoneGap?

1273
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,360
BRIAN LEROUX: I have
no idea, man.

1274
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:04,590
I don't know.

1275
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:07,490
I thought we'd be done
all this by now.

1276
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:09,130
CHRIS HEILMANN: Do you get a
lot of stuff in Adobe that

1277
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:11,730
people from AIR look at you
like we've done this.

1278
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:14,520
Why do you have to reinvent
it right now?

1279
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:14,890
BRIAN LEROUX: Actually, no.

1280
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:16,980
They're awesome.

1281
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:19,040
You could say that the road was
paved pretty easy and we

1282
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,240
have a good roadmap to
look forward to.

1283
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,180
Stuff that had been done
in the Flash Player and

1284
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:24,860
with AIR for sure.

1285
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:27,280
Yeah, they're cool.

1286
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,050
CHRIS HEILMANN: Good.

1287
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:31,630
What do you think will be
the next thing for you

1288
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:34,340
like Chrome app store?

1289
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:37,550
Will there be Chrome packaged
apps for mobile as well?

1290
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:39,970
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

1291
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:41,070
If you look on GitHub,
there's a public

1292
00:49:41,070 --> 00:49:43,750
repo and it uses Cordova.

1293
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:46,980
It's our easiest avenue to get
a consistent API stuck across

1294
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:49,450
those devices.

1295
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:52,180
The biggest thing for me is like
the API access whether

1296
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:53,030
it's cross browser or not.

1297
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:55,700
It's like the developer doesn't,
in theory, want to

1298
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:56,200
have to care.

1299
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,410
We're supposed to be trying to
solve that problem for them

1300
00:49:58,410 --> 00:50:00,470
with HTML in general.

1301
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:02,300
But we are at the stage where
everything is brand new and

1302
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:04,890
we've not really done this
device access thing before,

1303
00:50:04,890 --> 00:50:07,260
and we're all trying out
slightly different things.

1304
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:09,100
And at some point, we'll get
consensus and we'll have a

1305
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:10,590
nice model.

1306
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:13,490
But we need to prove that
built-in native apps is a

1307
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:16,410
thing that actually is going to
be cool and works, and we

1308
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:18,985
deliver great user experiences
with it.

1309
00:50:18,985 --> 00:50:21,700
CHRIS HEILMANN: Do you see a
slight competition between

1310
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:24,310
apps and asking for permissions
and browsers

1311
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:27,170
having things like WebRTC
and things inside?

1312
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:30,410
A lot of people come to me and
saw something on HTML Rocks

1313
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:31,700
like look in the latest
[? cannery ?]

1314
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:35,380
I can also take pictures so why
do you even complain about

1315
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:36,630
this anymore?

1316
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:40,400
It's like desktop browsers seem
to have some things that

1317
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,280
mobile browsers just
cannot get.

1318
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,700
And as developers, we try to
show off to each other but

1319
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:45,990
don't understand
the difference.

1320
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:48,910

1321
00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:49,680
BRIAN LEROUX: I wasn't
even aware.

1322
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,990
Is WebRTC really there?

1323
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:53,130
I mean, I know Firefox
and Chrome are

1324
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:54,363
talking to each other.

1325
00:50:54,363 --> 00:50:54,736
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1326
00:50:54,736 --> 00:50:57,060
It's coming to--

1327
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:58,270
BRIAN LEROUX: There's
that other browser.

1328
00:50:58,270 --> 00:51:02,080
I'm trying to remember,
Internet Explorer.

1329
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,330
CHRIS HEILMANN: Or the
Ericsson thing.

1330
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:04,710
Yeah.

1331
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:08,006
DIANA CHENG: I tried WebRTC
on Opera mobile.

1332
00:51:08,006 --> 00:51:11,630
So getUserMedia and it
prompts for permission but it

1333
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:12,520
didn't really work.

1334
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:14,360
It didn't really show
me my stream.

1335
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:17,560
So I don't know why.

1336
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:20,310
Maybe it's implementing a
previous version of the spec

1337
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:22,370
and I'm just asking it.

1338
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:25,170
BRIAN LEROUX: In many ways, all
this is not [INAUDIBLE]

1339
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:29,160
like the world of technology and
the web is advancing to a

1340
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:32,140
point where it is kind of all
hybrid and the differences

1341
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:35,200
between the native stack and
the web stack are getting

1342
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,890
blurrier by the second.

1343
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:39,890
I think that it's not going to
be like web versus native,

1344
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:42,110
it's just going to
be development.

1345
00:51:42,110 --> 00:51:44,680
Software development
will be of the web.

1346
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,480
CHRIS HEILMANN: Web GL is a
good point there as well.

1347
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,460
It gives you like full access to
the graphics hardware which

1348
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:52,210
you cannot do from anything else
which CSS shaders will

1349
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:54,660
have the same thing, which
another company it has a

1350
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:58,410
different 3D engine basically
said it's a security problem.

1351
00:51:58,410 --> 00:52:02,490
So we're not quite there yet
but we have a lot of

1352
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:04,690
technologies that try to do the
same thing but we don't

1353
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:06,540
seem to be there to
come up with a

1354
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,180
standard around that stuff.

1355
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:12,380
So where do you think
we should go next?

1356
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:14,900
Where do you think people
should push us

1357
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,600
to actually do things?

1358
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,910
I like people complaining and
filing bugs to browsers.

1359
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:21,880
I think they should much, much
more, but they should have a

1360
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:25,140
good ammunition to say this is
the first thing we need.

1361
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:26,030
PAUL KINLAN: I think they've
been saying that

1362
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:26,570
for a while, right?

1363
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:28,910
They want offline
apps to work.

1364
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:30,870
If it's an app, for instance,
they want that to work pretty

1365
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:33,420
much wherever they are
regardless of connection

1366
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:35,260
status and they want
it installed.

1367
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:37,440
They don't want to have to
launch a browser to go and

1368
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,060
launch an app to go and do
something that they would

1369
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:42,950
expect to just find on their
desktop and click and open.

1370
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:46,700
I think if we get those two
sorted, we're on a good path

1371
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:49,210
to working the rest out.

1372
00:52:49,210 --> 00:52:51,260
And then it's use case
lead from there.

1373
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:52,240
BRIAN LEROUX: Yeah, I agree.

1374
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,286
Totally.

1375
00:52:53,286 --> 00:52:54,600
Those are the biggest

1376
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,370
challenges for sure is offline.

1377
00:52:56,370 --> 00:52:59,632
Discovery may be another one
too, figuring out this app

1378
00:52:59,632 --> 00:53:00,690
store thing.

1379
00:53:00,690 --> 00:53:00,820
CHRIS HEILMANN: Yeah.

1380
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:03,860
Because we need a search engine
for app stores by now.

1381
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:05,990
There's far too many
out there already.

1382
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:08,020
It's tricky to actually--

1383
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:10,510
when promoting your app means to
have to go through like 40

1384
00:53:10,510 --> 00:53:12,560
different app stores, then
something went very wrong

1385
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,970
along the way because we had
the internet already to put

1386
00:53:14,970 --> 00:53:18,360
your content out there and get
it found by people like Google

1387
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,520
and others.

1388
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:21,380
Well thanks very much.

1389
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:22,960
So next we have tooling.

1390
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,210
Cheers!

1391
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:31,620
